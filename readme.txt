JAILERS

Jailers is a small action game that I made to practise Lua.
You play an incompetent mage who has just trapped themselves in their own inter-dimensional prison!
Use your wit and reflexes to evade the prison's traps as well as its guards, the eponymous jailers.

Jailers can be played with keyboard or a gamepad (use a gamepad though (seriously, use a gamepad)).
As it doesn't use any buttons you can play it one-handed. I've not tried it with any one-hand gamepads,
but either analogue stick on (for example) an Xbox 360 pad can be used.
